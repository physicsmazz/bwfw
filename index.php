                <p>Better ways for women was founded for the soul purpose of discovering and bringing about new ideas
                    and solutions to enhance a woman's needs. However, to do so with a more natural and organic
                    approach. Inspiration for our approach came from our general dissatisfaction and the lack of
                    improvements in women's care products and practices. Take a look for example at the feminine hygiene
                    products on the market today. Those combined with the accepted practices for women's hygiene havenâ€™t
                    changed in decades and their effectiveness left quite a bit to be desired from our point of view. So
                    in response to that, Better Ways For Women developed evarra&trade;. Evarra&trade; is the most innovative and
                    effective device ever created to help women achieve new levels in feeling ultimately the cleanest
                    and freshest they can, and doing so without the use of any chemicals whatsoever. From our research
                    most women rely on their fingers as their best means for vaginal cleansing so evarra&trade; was
                    specifically designed to be used in conjunction with and as an extension of the hand. Simply put, a
                    better way for women.
